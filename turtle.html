<h1>Turtlemania!</h1>
<p>
A game I developed as teenager to challenge my classmates by beating each others highscores.<br/>
As Anders Hejlsberg moved on to TypeScript, Turtlemania does as well
- play its re-implementation in TypeScript here:
</p>
<div>
<canvas id="turtlemania-canvas" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 100%; height: 500px"/>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, where is the turtle?</p>
<p>Originally the game has been developed using a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Turtle graphics</a>. That's where the name comes from.</div>
